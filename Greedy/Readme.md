Greedy Algorithms make best Decision at each step without looking ahead. Greedy Algorithms May not give the Optimal Solution all time.
Greedy Algoirthm is generally used when we want the optimal solution quickly.
* The greedy technique is used for optimization problems (where we have to find the maximum or minimum of something). 

<h3> When to Use / Properties of Greedy Algo </h3>

1. Greedy Choice : Overall Optimal solution can be reached by choosing the Optimal choice at each step
2. Optimal Sub Structure : A Problem has an Optimal Substructure if an optimal solution to the entire problem contains the optimal solutions to Sub Problems.

<h3> When not Use </h3>

1. If the Problem contains overlapping subproblemns, Greey should not be used. Dynamic Programming is used in that case.
2. When Optimal Solution is Mandatory (It can not always give Best Optimal Solution).
