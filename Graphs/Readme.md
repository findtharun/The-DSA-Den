A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(V, E).

<h3> Terminology </h3>

* Vertices u and v are Nieghbours if an Edge Connects them.
* Degree : Number of Edges Connected to Node.  (In Degree + Out Dgree)
    * In Degree : No. of Incoming Edges
    * Out Degress : No.of Outgoing Edges from Node
* Path : A sequence of Vertices connected by Edges.
* Path Length : Number of Edges in a Path.
<h4> Connectivity </h4>

* Two Vertices are connected if there is a path exists between them.
* A Graph is connected if all its nodes are connected (There Exists a path b/w all nodes).
* <b> Connected Component </b> : a subset of vertices that is connected.


<h2> Applications </h2>

* Sudoku Can be solved using Graphs.
