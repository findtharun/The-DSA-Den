Topological Sort has lot of real World Problems : Package Dependency Graph, Course Scheduling etc..

<b><i> A Topological Ordering  is an Ordering of the nodes in a directed acyclic graph where  for each edge from node A to node B , node A appears before node B in the Ordering. The Topological Sorting Algorithm can find topological Ordering in O(V+E) time .

NOTE : Topological Ordering are not Unique </i></b>
