* Level order Traversal == BFS (Breadth First Search)
* Inorder, Preorder, Postorder == DFS (Depth First Search)

* Height of Tree == Number of Levels / Max Depth of Tree
* Diameter/ Width of Tree == Largest Path Between any 2 Nodes in Tree (Path does not need to pass via root). We can Only Pass through the Edge only Once.
